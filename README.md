# PortaOne-test-task

In this project, I performed a test task

## Task

You need to develop an algorithm for a program that should do the following:

- the program accepts an arbitrary text as input and finds in each word of this text the very first symbol that is NOT repeated in the analyzed word
- further, from the received set of symbols, the program must select the first unique one (that is, the one that is no longer found in the set) and return it.

### I did it in two ways

1. Using built-in JS methods for array sorting such as (map, filter)

2. And a clean way using standard "for" iterations
